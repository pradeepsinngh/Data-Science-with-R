# Dataset:
The given data set "MLB2015data.csv" consist of following variables: Player name, Team, Position, Home Runs, etc.

# Problem:
* Create a factor variable called type with three levels: mid-infielders, outfielders, and other. The positions LF, CF, RF represent left, center, and right -- "Outfielders". Those who play the SS (shortstop) and 2B positions are "Mid- Infielders". The remaining positions should be in the “Other” group.
* Model the data "HR" (home runs) by "type" using a one-way anova model and test the hypothesis of equality of means for the variable HR. Interpret the results. 
* Using a non-parametric test, test the equality of means for the variable HR.
* Is the equality of variances assumption valid? Perform an appropriate test and interpret the results.
* Create a stripchart that shows the observations, the sample means, and a range that covers the observations that are one (sample) standard deviation from the (sample) mean.
