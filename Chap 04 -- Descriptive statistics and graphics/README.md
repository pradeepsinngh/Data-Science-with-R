# Dataset:
The health_dataset.txt contains the following variables: age, gender,(childhood) IQ, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), choles-terol level (CHOL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and body mass index (BMI).

# Problem 1:
* Create a factor variable (SBP.H) that records whether or not the subjects have high systolic blood pressure. Subjects with SBP >= 140 are considered to have high SBP. Levels of SBP should be "High SBP" and "Normal SBP".
* Create a freq table for the variable  SBP.H.
* Create a 2-by-2 frequency table for SBP.H (rows) and GENDER (columns). What percanetage of males and females have high sysotlic blood pressure? Obtain a 2-by-2 table that shows these percentages.
* Create a piechart for the variable SBP.H.
* Create stacked and clustered bar charts for SBP.H by gender.

# Problem 2:
* Create a factor variable called SBP.H as you have done in problem 1 above.
* Create side-by-side histograms and boxplots of DBP by SBP.H.
* Find appropriate summary statistics for DBP. Find the same summary statistics (of DBP) separately for subjects with high SBP and for subjects with normal SBP.
* Create a variable called DBP.H that records whether or not the subjects have high diastolic blood pressure (DBP ≥ 90).(The levels of the variable DBP.H should be “High DBP” and “Normal DBP”.)
* Create a 2-by-2 frequency table for SBP.H (rows) and DBP.H (columns). 
* What percent of subjects that have high systolic blood pressure also have high diastolic blood pressure? 
* What percent of subjects that have normal systolic blood pressure also have normal diastolic blood pressure? Obtain a 2-by-2 table that shows these percentages.
