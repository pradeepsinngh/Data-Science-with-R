# Dataset:
The health_dataset.txt contains the following variables: age, gender,(childhood) IQ, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), choles-terol level (CHOL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and body mass index (BMI).

# Problem 1:
* Create a factor variable (SBP.H) that records whether or not the subjects have high systolic blood pressure. Subjects with SBP >= 140 are considered to have high SBP. Levels of SBP should be "High SBP" and "Normal SBP".
* Create a freq table for the variable  SBP.H.
* Create a 2-by-2 frequency table for SBP.H (rows) and GENDER (columns). What percanetage of males and females have high sysotlic blood pressure? Obtain a 2-by-2 table that shows these percentages.
* Create a piechart for the variable SBP.H.
* Create stacked and clustered bar charts for SBP.H by gender.

# Problem 2:
