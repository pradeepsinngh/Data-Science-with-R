# Dataset:
The health_dataset.txt contains the following variables: age, gender,(childhood) IQ, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), choles-terol level (CHOL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and body mass index (BMI).

# Problem:
* For the variables SBP, HDL, and CHOL:
** Test if there are gender (mean) differences.  Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses, and give the p-value and conclusion of the test. Use α = 0.05. Assume the population SDs (for males and females) are (nearly) equal.
** Test if the equal SD (variance) assumption is appropriate.
* Is the population mean of SBP greater than that of DBP? To answer this question, perform a hypothesis test.  Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses, and give the p-value and conclusion of the test.  Use α = 0.05.
* Calculate the sample size (in each group) required to detect a mean difference of 5 HDL points with a power of 0.90.
