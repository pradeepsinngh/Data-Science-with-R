# Dataset:
-- health_dataset.txt
The health_dataset.txt contains the following variables: age, gender,(childhood) IQ, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), choles-terol level (CHOL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and body mass index (BMI).

-- cleanPIMA.txt
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases conducted a study on 768 adult female Pima Indians (at least 21 years old) living near Phoenix. The following variables were recorded: regnancies, glucose, diastolic, triceps, insulin, bmi, age, test.

# Problem: Perform hypothesis test (t-test)
* For the variables SBP, HDL, and CHOL: Test if there are gender (mean) differences.
* Test if the equal SD (variance) assumption is appropriate.
* Is the population mean of SBP greater than that of DBP?
* Calculate the sample size (in each group) required to detect a mean difference of 5 HDL points with a power of 0.90.
